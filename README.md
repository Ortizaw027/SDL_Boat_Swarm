Unmanned Surface Vehicle SwarmProject OverviewThis project developed a functional swarm of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) capable of coordinated movement using a centralized controller and a Leader-Follower dynamic approach over a secure LoRa network. The goal was to demonstrate enhanced efficiency, resilience, and safety for maritime tasks compared to single-unit operations.Authors: Dominic Mesagna & Antonio OrtizKey Objectives AchievedDeveloped a functioning swarm of two USVs.Integrated GPS and Compass sensors for navigation.Established a secure LoRa network for communication.Implemented a Centralized Controller for management and monitoring.Demonstrated coordinated movement using a Leader-Follower algorithm.Technology HighlightsHardware: Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, NEO-6M GPS, HMC5883L Compass, RYLR896 LoRa, TB6612FNG Motor Driver, custom-integrated RC boat hulls.Software: Python-based control scripts (LeaderBoat.py, FollowerBoat.py, Controller.py) utilizing pigpio, serial, and smbus2 libraries.Component Testing ScriptsThe sensor_test_programs directory within this repository contains dedicated Python scripts designed for the isolated functional verification and characterization of individual hardware components, including motor control, GPS data acquisition, and compass readings. These scripts facilitate granular testing and debugging of the sensor and actuator interfaces prior to integrated system deployment.Results SummaryControlled testing demonstrated coordinated movement and reliable communication between the two USVs. The system successfully integrated sensor data for navigation and maintained communication links for control and telemetry reporting.AcknowledgmentsThis project was made possible with the generous support from Drone City, who aided in the purchasing of the resources used in this project.Demo VideoA short video demonstrating the project's results can be found here:[Link to Demo Video Here]Note: Remember to replace [Link to Demo Video Here] with the actual link to your video file or hosting platform.
